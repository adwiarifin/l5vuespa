## About

Laravel has become the most popular choice for developing PHP projects. One important reason for this popularity is the built in support for Vue.js, a very fast growing JavaScript library for developing impressive front-ends.

This combination results is fast, secure and very impressive applications that need minimum time to go from ideation to final code review. The support for Vue.js means that Laravel developers could use Vue components easily within their apps without wasting time in writing integrations for the components. To demonstrate the support, I decided to create a single page application in Laravel with a Vue.js powered frontend.
